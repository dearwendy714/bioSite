                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Assembly District 69 is in the heart of Orange County and the center of democracy when it comes to a diverse population seeking representation. My name is Richard Santana and I have lived in Santa Ana all my life. Santa Ana is a city with open arms for inclusivity and representation. My city has taught me the importance of giving back, speaking up for my community and reacting to the injustices in our political climate, which is why I am seeking to be a delegate for the 69TH Assembly District.</p>
                <p>I have a strong background in community organizing and advocacy from my work with Labor, running several political campaigns here in Orange County, and working as community redevelopment and housing commissioner. I am proud and honored of the accomplishments our young progressive high students and our team did by registering 25,000 democrats in the 34th Senate District and helping engineer the surprise defeat of Republican Janet Nguyen. Coming from a diverse background, politics has contributed to the person I currently am. This last election has taught me that there is still work that has yet to be done when it comes to protecting voter rights, empowering individuals to be informed and involved with what occurs in their community, and have a better understanding of how immigration impacts our daily life.</p>
                <p>As a delegate, I hope to be an example for the next wave of activists who will protect and defend democracy from local to national affairs. This past election was a clear demonstration of the importance of how every vote matters. If it were not for the people who participated in the electoral process, we would have not won Senate District 34. With our recent victories, there is a massive amount of work that needs to be done in AD69.</p>
                <p>This district has helped me amplify my voice by giving me a platform to vocalize the struggles our community face. With your support, we must continue protecting our diverse community, the rights of our community members and empowering individuals who reside in the AD69 to be part of a change. I would be humbled and deeply honored to serve as your 69th district delegate!</p>
